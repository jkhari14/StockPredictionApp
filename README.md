# Comprehensive Stock Market Analysis and Machine Learning in React Native App

This README provides an in-depth overview of the SPA Stock Prediction app,

## Introduction

This React Native app aims to bring the power of comprehensive stock market analysis and machine learning to mobile devices. It seamlessly integrates elements from two different READMEs, focusing on processing a vast directory of CSV files containing daily stock data, identifying significant stocks, and utilizing machine learning models for predictive analysis.

## Data

The dataset, stored in a Google Drive directory, comprises CSV files containing daily stock information, including:

- Stock name
- Date
- Open price
- High price
- Low price
- Close price
- Volume
- Adjusted closing price

Python scripts will still be employed to process the data within the app.

## Process and Preparation

The initial steps involve preprocessing the data, which includes:

- Loading CSV files into JavaScript objects
- Cleaning and normalizing the data
- Filtering out irrelevant data points
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets

## Stock Selection

The app identifies the largest and most significant stocks using a function akin to `find_files_with_encompassing_date_range`. It searches for files with date ranges that encompass a given date range, ensuring the correct date format using a helper function like `check_date_format`.

## Machine Learning Models

The React Native app will utilize various machine learning models for predictive analysis, including:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines
- Neural Networks

These models will be integrated using appropriate libraries compatible with React Native.

## Training and Evaluation

Models will be trained using the training data and evaluated using testing data. Evaluation metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Coefficient of Determination (R-squared), will provide insights into model performance.

## Results and Discussion

The app will display the results of machine learning models, highlighting the best-performing ones and their ability to predict future trends. The interface will also facilitate discussions and insights gained during the analysis.

## Conclusion

The conclusion within the app will summarize the successes and limitations of using machine learning techniques for predicting stock market trends. It will also provide recommendations for future work and improvements, making it accessible to users exploring the app.

Certainly! Here's the updated section reflecting the tools and libraries used in the React Native app:

## Tools and Libraries

The React Native app integrates various tools and libraries, including:

- React Native
- JavaScript
- External libraries for machine learning integration
- Google Drive API for data retrieval
- Charting libraries for visual representation
- **Python:** Used for data preprocessing and initial analysis scripts.
- **Pandas:** Employed for data manipulation and analysis within the Python scripts.
- **NumPy:** Used for numerical computations and array operations in the Python scripts.
- **Scikit-learn:** Utilized for implementing machine learning models and evaluation metrics.
- **Google Colab:** Initially employed for data analysis and machine learning pipeline execution in Python.
- **Matplotlib:** Utilized for creating visualizations within the Python scripts.
- **Datetime:** Used for handling date-related operations during data processing.

This diverse set of tools and libraries ensures the app's capability to deliver a comprehensive stock market analysis and machine learning experience on mobile devices.


## Usage

To utilize the React Native app:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Upload the CSV files containing stock data to a Google Drive directory.
3. Build and run the React Native app on your mobile device.
4. Explore the comprehensive stock analysis and machine learning features directly from your mobile device.
5. Make informed investment decisions based on the results.
